# Preface

Hi, I am a programmer. From March 2018, I began learning go programming language. Also, I got in touch with the golang debugger **delve**. One day, suddenly flashed a question in my mind. **How does a debugger like delve work?**

If you just want to understand the general working principle, this is relatively simple. You could check the **basics ** chapters, or go to read some online articles. While if you want to know more internals so that you could develop a debugger from scratch, that's another thing.

The design, implementation, and debugging information standard of the debugger is also a very complicated project. I hope to have a glimpse of the mystery and help me to further understand the software development tool chain. In the process of learning, I also realize that this is a good practice. The technical details we will get in touched is very valuable, which helps to consolidate and improve the software developer's knowledge system from multiple aspects. So I hope to complete this project and share it with everyone.

Of course, because the author's own level is limited, it is inevitable that there will be mistakes or omissions. I also hope that readers could give me advices and I'll correct them in time.
